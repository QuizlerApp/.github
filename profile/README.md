# Quizler

Quizler is a mobile application aimed at making learning approachable for young learners. Today's technology-obsessed youth have a very short attention span and expect immediate gratification from their actions. In this atmosphere, the culture of learning and skill development often suffers. Quizler aims to bridge the gap between fun and learning by making information available in small, easy increments while giving the user a chance to gain from the knowledge almost instantly. Quizler aims to build a quizzing culture around the country and the world by taking a learning-first approach.
